Relative rate estimation, method ranking using known simulated true rates

True model is Baranyi.

True curves: 

* Random positive starting value unif[0.01, 5]
* Random asymptote A unif[50, 100]
* Random rate, unif[.5,3]
* Random lag, unif[0,5]
 

The challenges, nested:

1. Noise: Additive gaussian noise at log scale, varying sigma, 3 values low medium large
    2. Frequency: 0.5, 1, 2 times a day
        3. Early stop: no (upto 14), mid (8) censoring
            4. Crashes: no crash, mid (8) crash

so for(sigma) 
    for(times_a_day)
        for(upto)
            for(crash_after)
            
just run this in blocks of say 5000 curves, so we can compute in bits and the results will not increase in number but in accuracy.


run01: fix A = 100 rate = 1 (this was chosen for the publication)
run02: fix A = 100
run03: all free
